Build an “All-in-One Life OS” web app (productivity + finance + journaling) with multi-user accounts and private data per user.

Tech / constraints:
- Use Next.js (App Router) with a clean, minimal UI (responsive, calm, modern).
- Implement email/password authentication and ensure data privacy per user (each user only sees their own data).
- Keep the implementation as simple as possible: prioritize a working MVP over perfection.
- If full cloud auth/DB is too heavy, still scaffold the structure and use a temporary in-app storage layer (in-memory or localStorage) with clearly marked TODOs to swap to a real DB later.

Core navigation (top or side nav):
- Dashboard
- Productivity
- Calendar (Plans)
- Finance
- Journal
- Insights
- Settings

1) Dashboard (Command Center)
Show cards/widgets:
- Live current time
- Weather widget (can start as placeholder; add real API integration if easy)
- Countdown to next salary payout (user can set payout schedule in Settings: fixed dates like 15/30 or custom payday)
- Today’s routines (checklist)
- Tasks due today
- Quick finance snapshot (current balance + projected end-of-month)

2) Productivity module
A) Routines
- Users can create routine templates (e.g., “Morning routine”) with checklist steps.
- Users can mark steps done for today.
- Show streaks and completion rate.

B) Tasks & Goals
- Tasks: title, due date, priority, status, tags
- Goals: title, target date, checklist/milestones
- Link tasks to goals optionally
- Simple “Today / Upcoming / Completed” views

3) Plans Calendar (Future Activities)
- A calendar page for events/activities (not finance).
- Users can add events with title, date/time, category, notes, reminders (basic).
- Month view is enough; weekly/day view optional if easy.

4) Finance module (AntiGastador-style)
A) Transactions + Calendar
- Add income/expense entries with: type, amount, date, category, note
- Support recurring transactions (once, daily, weekly, monthly, every N days)
- Calendar view shows daily totals and a running projected balance
- Allow setting a starting balance for a month
- Allow “Actual balance override” per day (if set, projections after that recalc from reality)
- Month summary: income, expenses, projected end balance
- Expense breakdown by category (simple chart)

B) Debt tracker (cool visual)
- Users can add debts: name, total, remaining, due date, interest optional
- Users can record payments and reduce remaining balance
- Use a motivating visual metaphor (choose one):
  - “Melting Ice Block” (debt melts as you pay)
  - or “Breaking Chains” (links break per payment)
Implement it as a progress visualization (simple CSS/animation is fine, doesn’t need to be fancy).

C) Savings goals (jar UI)
- Users can create savings goals: name, target amount, current saved
- Add deposits to increase saved amount
- Show a jar/bottle progress visualization that fills up as savings increase

5) Journal module
- Daily journal entries: date, text, optional mood
- Archive view: browse by calendar or list, with search

6) Insights (Statistics)
Provide simple visual stats (charts can be basic):
- Finance: spending by category, income vs expense trend, savings progress, debt payoff progress
- Productivity: tasks completed per week, routine streaks, goal progress
Keep it lightweight and avoid overengineering.

7) Settings
- User profile
- Payday configuration (for countdown)
- Currency (default PHP)
- Theme (light/dark)

Deliverables:
- A running app with the above pages and basic CRUD for each module.
- Clear data models (even if stored temporarily).
- Comments/TODOs where you simplify or defer hard parts.
- Make sure the UX is smooth: quick add buttons, empty states, and consistent components.
